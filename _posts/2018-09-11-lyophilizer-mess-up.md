At 10:30 am, I went to the lyoppilizer room and met up with Megan. My samples had gotten all over the inside of the manifold. Sam thinks it's likely because the sampels thawed before they got on the lyophilizer, which is very likely because I brought them over on wet ice as opposed to dry ice. WIll try again at 4:30pm (bringing them over on dry ice) and Sam will grab them in the morning on Thursday. I will also test this out only with screw cap tubes and have them slightly unscrewed. Megan also noticed that the vacuum didn't get below 100 mtorr, which it should... so the manifold likely wasn't sealed properly. So Megan added a lot more grease.
